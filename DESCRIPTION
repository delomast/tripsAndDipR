Description: Uses read counts for biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
    to compare the likelihoods for the observed read counts given that a sample is 
    either diploid or triploid. It allows parameters to be specified to account for 
    sequencing error rates and allelic bias. For details of the algorithm, please see
    Delomas (2019) <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.13073>.
